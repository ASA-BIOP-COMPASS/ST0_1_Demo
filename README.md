Bootstrap Confidence Interval EstimatorThis repository contains an R implementation of the Non-parametric Bootstrap method to estimate the 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for a population mean.📖 What is Bootstrapping?Bootstrapping is a resampling technique used to estimate statistics on a population by sampling a dataset with replacement. It allows us to calculate measures of accuracy (like standard errors or confidence intervals) to sample estimates without making strong assumptions about the distribution of the underlying population (e.g., assuming normality).The MathGiven a sample $X = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\}$, we:Resample $n$ observations from $X$ with replacement to create a bootstrap sample $X^*$.Compute the statistic of interest (e.g., the mean $\bar{x}^*$) for this resample.Repeat this process $B$ times (typically $B=1000$ or $10,000$).Construct the confidence interval from the resulting distribution of $\bar{x}^*$.For a $95\%$ confidence interval using the percentile method, we find values $\theta_{2.5\%}$ and $\theta_{97.5\%}$ such that:$$P(\theta_{2.5\%} \leq \bar{X} \leq \theta_{97.5\%}) = 0.95$$📊 IllustrationThe code generates a histogram showing the distribution of the bootstrap means.Blue Line: The observed mean of our original sample.Red Dashed Lines: The 95% Confidence Interval boundaries.(After running the code, your plot will appear here)🚀 How to RunClone this repository.Open bootstrap_analysis.R in RStudio or your preferred R environment.Run the script.Check the console for the calculated CI values and the plots/ folder for the visualization.📦 RequirementsR (4.0.0+)ggplot2
